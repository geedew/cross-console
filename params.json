{"name":"Cross-console","tagline":"A console approach to make sure console is available and can be stifled under the right situations.","body":"# Cross-Console script\r\nSometimes you just need to control the console. This script provides you with a way to control and take advantage of your console for what it was meant to do (log stuff). Leave the debugging to your breakpoints, start logging your code!\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n - attempts to implement console in all environments, or extends the console available.\r\n - can have console behave differently in `development` versus `production`\r\n - ability to send console.error to another Function while in production (for easier error management like sending an email)\r\n - using localStorage, a history is kept of all previous logs, limited to 100 ( configurable )\r\n - add a filter so that you only see the logs you want ( will persist accross refresh in a browser, history will retain all logs )\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n## Via bower\r\n```\r\n$> bower install cross-console \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Via NPM\r\n```\r\n$> npm install cross-console\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Download Manually\r\n\r\n* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option\r\n* Use either the compressed `bin/cross-console.min.js` or the `lib/cross-console.js` file.\r\n\r\n## Add a script path in your source\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/bin/cross-console.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Accessing the original console\r\nSome consoles give useful information like timing and memory usage; so you still have access to that\r\n\r\n# Settings\r\nTo change from the default settings, just access the code via the window or root object. Notice that `cconsole` and `console` are interchangeable\r\n```js\r\nwindow.cconsole.settings || window.console.settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also change the settings by accessing the `set` function and passing an object of key:value pairs of the following.\r\n```js\r\nwindow.console.set({\r\n\t\"environment\": \"production\",\r\n\t\"debug\": false,\r\n\t\"notify\":function(msg,identifier) {\r\n\t\talert(msg,identifier);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.standBy`\r\n>default `false` ( boolean )\r\n\r\nStand By will effectively turn off CConsole. It will act as if it was not even there.\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.debug`\r\n>default `false` ( boolean )\r\n\r\nDebug turns on all logs so that the console will light up with everything that is thrown at it.\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.environment`\r\n>default `production` ( string: `development` || `production` )\r\n\r\nThis is the smartest addition to the code. Effectively, you can be in 'development' mode to be able to see all `console.error` and `console.warn` come through. If you are in `production` mode you will not see anything. If debug is on, it will overwrite this setting and allow everything to come through.\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.notify`\r\n>default `function(error, identifier) { return; }` ( function )\r\n\r\nYou can overwrite this functionality in your own code. This function will be called for every `console.error` that occurs. This allows you to have a second set of loggin occur on that error, like a server backend to track them or graph them, etc.\r\n\r\n - error : this is the string that was given to console.error\r\n - identifier : this is intended to be a line item that is unique to this error, to make for easier debugging.\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.filter`\r\n>default `false` ( string )\r\n\r\nAllows the code to only show things in the console log that fit the filter that's applied. Use the `console.setFilter(string)` to apply a filter and `console.clearFilter()` to remove the filter.  __It will not filter out errors or warnings and will attempt to persist if localStorage and JSON are available using the key 'CC.filter'__\r\n\r\n## `window.cconsole.settings.history`\r\n>default `100` ( integer )\r\n\r\nThis is the length of the history that is kept. Having a large enough number for good use, and a low enough number to stop overgrowth is essential. __History will perist in localStorage if JSON and storage is available, using the key `CC.history`__\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n## Basic changing of settings\r\n```js\r\nwindow.console.warn('Will not show up due to defaults');\r\n// Change to development and debug\r\nwindow.cconsole.settings.environment = 'development';\r\nwindow.console.warn('Warns will show up while in development');\r\n\r\nwindow.cconsole.settings.debug = true;\r\nwindow.console.log('Everything will show up in console');\r\n\r\nwindow.cconsole.settings.standBy = true;\r\nwindow.console.log('Actually just using the log if it`s there');\r\n\r\n// window.cconsole.settings.history //> array of all of the above, except the last console log because standBy was turned on\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Catching console.error in production\r\n```js\r\nwindow.cconsole.settings.notify = function(error, key) {\r\n mailEngineers(error, key);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.error('This should not have happened'); // runs notify -> presumably sends emails to engineers\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Filtering out only the messages you expect to see\r\n```js\r\nwindow.cconsole.setFilter('myfeature');\r\n\r\nconsole.log('somefeature','this isnt showing');\r\nconsole.log('myfeature', 'this is showing');\r\nconsole.warn('this will always show up, so will errors');\r\n\r\nwindow.cconsole.clearFilter();\r\nconsole.log('somefeature','now shows');\r\n```\r\n\r\n# License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Drew@geedew.com \r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
